        <h2 class="section-title">Meet the Owner</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Eunajem, and hair has been a part of my life since I was
            eight years old. I began styling family and friends and honed my craft
            over the years in my mother’s and sister’s hair. What started as a
            hobby quickly grew into a passion and, ultimately, my profession.
        </p>
        <p>
            I founded Eunajem Studios to offer young women a place where they can
            cultivate their talent, build confidence and become self‑sufficient.
            Impact means everything to me, and empowering others through beauty
            is my way of making a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, Eunajem Studios is a welcoming salon in the heart of London
            that serves clients of all ages and backgrounds. We pride ourselves
            on creating beautiful styles, nurturing up‑and‑coming stylists and
            fostering a positive, inclusive environment.
